TODO:
-predicting seems very expensive how do I fix?
-New model is ready, but how do i create teamcomps with crazy win percentages?
-start drafting website?
-winrates seem very very reliant on patch meta how to diversify? 
    -Compute the win rate for each champion by counting the number of wins and losses for each champion in the dataset.
    -For each champion, calculate the number of games that need to be removed in order to achieve a 50% win rate.
    -Remove a proportional number of wins and losses for each champion to balance their win rates.
    -Repeat steps 1-3 until all champions have a win rate close to 50%.
    -Once all champions have a win rate close to 50%, shuffle the rows of the dataframe to ensure that the data is randomized.
    -Use this normalized and shuffled data to train your model.
